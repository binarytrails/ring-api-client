## Development

The manifests of Firefox & Chrome are different. Make a copy of the one you want for the browser of you choice and name it *manifest.json*. Chrome has issues with SVG which means it's better to use PNG format for the default icon.

### Firefox

1. Go to *about:debugging#addons*
2. Click *Load Temporary Add-on*
3. Select the *manifest.json*

### Chrome

1. Go to *chrome://extensions/*
2. Check *Developer mode*
3. Click *Load unpacked extension*
