# Ring-webextension

It's using the [Ring API](https://github.com/sevaivanov/ring-api).

> WebExtensions are a new way to write browser extensions. The technology is designed for cross-browser compatibility: to a large extent the API is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with multiprocess Firefox. -- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions)
